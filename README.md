# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks
In this chapter you will be introduced to the final topic on neural networks and deep learning. You will come across TensorFlow, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). You will also be implementing an image classification program using neural networks and deep learning.
